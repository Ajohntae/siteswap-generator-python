#Check the number of inputs
#333 = 3
#And then it would check to see if  the numbers where divisible by the number of inputs
#333 = 9 = divisible by 3
#441 = 9 = divisible by 3
#So it would take the input i.e numbers i.e (441) as an example
#& reinterpret it as( 4,4,1)â€¨check to see how many inputs there are (3)
#Add the numbers  (4+4+1 = 9 )
#Check to see if that number is divisible by the number of inputs.
#(4+4+1 = 9 % 3)
#And if it is it would return it as a valid site swap.
#Otherwise, it would return it as invalid.)
